You have several ways to contribute to Tungsteno, the easiest way is reporting
bugs or requesting new features, but you can work hand by hand with me.

Nowdays, we're using Github for project management:

- You can create a new issue, or request a feature
[here](https://github.com/tungstenoapp/Tungsteno/issues/new)
- You can check opened issues for checking issues and new features requests.
